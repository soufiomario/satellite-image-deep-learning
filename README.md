# Techniques
This section explores the different deep and machine learning techniques people are applying to common problems in satellite imagery analysis. Classification problems are the most simply addressed via DL, object detection is harder, and cloud detection harder still (niche interest). Note that almost all imagery data on the internet is in RGB format, and common techniques designed for working with this 3 band imagery may fail or need significant adaptation to work with multiband data (e.g. 13-band Sentinel 2).

## Land classification - RGB data
Assign a label to an image, e.g. this is an image of a forest. With RGB imagery 'off the shelf' neural net architectures can be applied

## Object detection
A good introduction to the challenge of performing object detection on aerial imagery is given in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06042v2). In summary, images are large and objects may comprise only a few pixels, easily confused with random features in background. An example task is detecting boats on the ocean, which should be simpler than land based detection owing to the relatively blank background in images, but is still challenging.

* From [this article on sentinelhub](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/improving-cloud-detection-with-machine-learning-c09dc5d7cf13) there are three popular classical algorithms that detects thresholds in multiple bands in order to identify clouds. In the same article they propose using semantic segmentation combined with a CNN for a cloud classifier (excellent review paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.06857.pdf)), but state that this requires too much compute resources.

# Miscellaneous (generally) non ML Techniques
## Pansharpening
Image fusion of low res multispectral with high res pan band.
* Several algorithms described [in the ArcGIS docs](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/fundamentals-of-panchromatic-sharpening.htm), with the simplest being taking the mean of the pan and RGB pixel value.
* Does not require DL, classical algos suffice, [see this notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HyperionAnalytics/PyDataNYC2014/blob/master/panchromatic_sharpening.ipynb) and [this kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/resolut/panchromatic-sharpening)
* https://github.com/mapbox/rio-pansharpen

## NVDI - vegetation index
* Simple band math `ndvi = np.true_divide((ir - r), (ir + r))` but challenging due to the size of the imagery.

* Traditional approach -> define control points, employ RANSAC algorithm
* [Phase correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_correlation) is used to estimate the translation between two images with sub-pixel accuracy. Can be used for accurate registration of low resolution imagery onto high resolution imagery, or to register a [sub-image on a full image](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/registering-an-image-using-normalized-cross-correlation.html) -> Unlike many spatial-domain algorithms, the phase correlation method is resilient to noise, occlusions, and other defects.

## Cloud Optimised GeoTiff (COG)
A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a regular GeoTIFF file with an internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud. In particular they support HTTP range requests, enabling downloading of specific tiles rather than the full file. COGs work normally in GIS software such as QGIS, but are larger than regular GeoTIFFs

## STAC - SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog specification
The STAC specification provides a common metadata specification, API, and catalog format to describe geospatial assets, so they can more easily indexed and discovered. The aim is that the catalogue is crawlable so it can be indexed by a search engine and make imagery discoverable, without requiring yet another API interface. A good place to start is to view the [Planet Disaster Data catalogue](https://planet.stac.cloud/) which has the [catalogue source on Github](https://github.com/cholmes/pdd-stac) and uses the [stac-browser](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-browser)
* Spec at https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec

* [This article discusses some of the available platforms](https://medium.com/pangeo/cloud-native-geoprocessing-of-earth-observation-satellite-data-with-pangeo-997692d91ca2)
* [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io/index.html) -> There is no single software package called “pangeo”; rather, the Pangeo project serves as a coordination point between scientists, software, and computing infrastructure. Includes open source resources for parallel processing using Dask and Xarray. Pangeo recently announced their 2.0 goals: pivoting away from directly operating cloud-based JupyterHubs, and towards eductaion and research
* [Airbus Sandbox](https://sandbox.intelligence-airbusds.com/web/) -> will provide access to imagery
* [Descartes Labs](https://www.descarteslabs.com/) -> access to EO imagery from a variety of providers via python API
* DigitalGlobe have a cloud hosted Jupyter notebook platform called [GBDX](https://gbdxdocs.digitalglobe.com/docs/about-the-gbdx-platform). Cloud hosting means they can guarantee the infrastructure supports their algorithms, and they appear to be close/closer to deploying DL.
* Planet have a [Jupyter notebook platform](https://developers.planet.com/) which can be deployed locally.

# Free online computing resources
Generally a GPU is required for DL, and this section lists a couple of free Jupyter environments with GPU available. There is a good overview of online Jupyter development environments [on the fast.ai site](https://course19.fast.ai). I personally use Colab with data hosted on Google Drive

### Google Colab
* Collaboratory [notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com) with GPU as a backend for free for 12 hours at a time. Note that the GPU may be shared with other users, so if you aren't getting good performance try reloading.
* Also a pro tier for $10 a month -> https://colab.research.google.com/signup
* Tensorflow  pytorch can be installed

### Kaggle - also Google!
* Free to use
* GPU Kernels - may run for 1 hour
* Tensorflow, pytorch & fast.ai available
* Advantage that many datasets are already available

# Production
For an overview on serving deepl learning models checkout [Practical-Deep-Learning-on-the-Cloud](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/-Practical-Deep-Learning-on-the-Cloud).

### Rest API on dedicated server
A conceptually simple approach to serving up deep learning model inference code is to wrap it in a rest API. That can be implemented in python (flask or FastAPI), and hosted on a dedicated server e.g. EC2 instance
* Basic API: https://blog.keras.io/building-a-simple-keras-deep-learning-rest-api.html with code [here](https://github.com/jrosebr1/simple-keras-rest-api)
* Advanced API with request queuing: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/01/29/scalable-keras-deep-learning-rest-api/

### Framework specific serving options
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving) and [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/serve) specific serving

### AWS
* Host your data on [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and metadata in a relational db such as [postgres](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/)
* For batch processing use [Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) to run python scripts. Break out units of processing into [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions. Note that lambda may not be a particularly quick solution for deep learning applications, since you do not have the option to batch inference on a GPU. There is also a hard runtime limit of 15 minutes, and creating a container with all the required dependencies can be a challenge. To get started read [Using container images to run PyTorch models in AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/using-container-images-to-run-pytorch-models-in-aws-lambda/)
* Use [Step functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) to orchestrate data pipelines on batch and lambda. If this is too limited or you want to write pipelines in python (rather than json used by step functions) checkout [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/)
* [Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is a hosted Jupyter environment for training and deployment of ML models.
* [Deep learning AMIs](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/) are EC2 instances with deep learning frameworks preinstalled. They do require more setup from the user than Sagemaker but in return allow access to the underlying hardware, which makes debugging issues more straightforward. There is a [good guide to setting up your AMI instance on the Keras blog](https://blog.keras.io/running-jupyter-notebooks-on-gpu-on-aws-a-starter-guide.html)
* [Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels-features/) custom labels is a 'no code' annotation, training and inferencing service. Read [Training models using Satellite (Sentinel-2) imagery on Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels](https://ryfeus.medium.com/training-models-using-satellite-imagery-on-amazon-rekognition-custom-labels-dd44ac6a3812). For a comparison with Azure and Google alternatives [read this article](https://blog.roboflow.com/automl-vs-rekognition-vs-custom-vision/)
* When developing you will definitely want to use [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) and probably [aws-data-wrangler](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler)
* For managing infrastructure use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Alternatively if you wish to use TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, or C# checkout [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/), although I found relatively few examples to get going using python

If you are performing object detection you will need to annotate images with bounding boxes. Check that your annotation tool of choice supports large image (likely geotiff) files, as not all will. Note that GeoJSON is widely used by remote sensing researchers but this annotation format is not commonly supported in general computer vision frameworks, and in practice you may have to convert the annotation format to use the data with your chosen framework. There are both closed and open source tools for creating and converting annotation formats.
* A long list of tools is [here](https://simonwenkel.com/2019/07/19/list-of-annotation-tools-for-machine-learning-research.html)

# About the author
My background is in optical physics, and I hold a PhD from Cambridge on the topic of [localised surface Plasmons](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl0710506). Since academia I have held a variety of roles, including doing research at [Sharp Labs Europe](https://www.sle.sharp.co.uk/), developing optical systems at [Surrey Satellites](https://www.sstl.co.uk/) (SSTL), and working at an IOT startup. It was whilst at SSTL that I started this repository as a personal resource. Over time I have steadily gravitated towards data analytics and software engineering with python, and I now work as a senior data scientist at [Satellite Vu](https://www.satellitevu.com/). Please feel free to connect with me on Twitter & LinkedIn, and please do let me know if this repository is useful to your work.
